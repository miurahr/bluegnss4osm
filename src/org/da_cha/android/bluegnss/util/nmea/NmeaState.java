   * RMC sentence.
   * Assumes just after GGA, starting new sequence of sentences.
   * When accepting VTG, sequence is lasted.
   *
   * An input file may have both GGA and GLL and RMC sentences for the exact
   * same position fix. If we see a single GGA, start ignoring GLL's and RMC's.
   * GLL's will also be ignored if RMC's are found and GGA's not found.
